Hey ! I'm a french student mainly interested in computer science and mathematics. This website is meant to quickly show what I'm interested in, as well as to be a platform for me to write whatever I want.
<br>
There are not a lot of interesting things to look at for now, but if you are a recruiter, you might be interested in my CV, which has its own <a href="https://aparesy.github.io/cv/">dedicated page</a>.
<br>
Also, if you're into competitive programming, here are my <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/aparesy56">Codeforces</a> and <a href="https://atcoder.jp/users/aparesy56">Atcoder</a> profiles !
