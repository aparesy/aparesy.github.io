This is a math write-up I made two years ago for the TIPE part of my competitive exams. It actually ended up being useless since Polytechnique replaces the TIPE with a scientific document analysis exam, which feels fairer since the quality of the TIPE can depend a lot on your professors and connections. The paper tackles a beautiful theorem at the intersection between topology and game theory discovered in 1953 by Gale and Stewart.
