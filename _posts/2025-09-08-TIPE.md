This is a math write-up I made two years ago for the TIPE part of my competitive exams. It actually ended up being useless since Polytechnique replaces the TIPE with a scientific document analysis exam, which feels fairer since the quality of the TIPE can depend a lot on your professors and connections. The paper tackles a beautiful theorem at the intersection between topology and game theory discovered in 1953 by Gale and Stewart.

The theorem basically states that in an infinite game with only loss and win possible, then you can take A the set of winning (infinite) games, and if that set is closed or open, then the game is deterministic in the sense that one player always has a winning strategy. There are actually more results if A is an F-sigma or a G-delta but I already had enough content for the twenty-minute presentation.
