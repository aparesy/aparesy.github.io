This is a math write-up I made two years ago for the TIPE part of my competitive exams. It actually ended up being useless since Polytechnique replaces the TIPE with a scientific document analysis exam, which feels fairer since the quality of the TIPE can depend a lot on your professors and connections. The paper tackles a beautiful theorem at the intersection between topology and game theory discovered in 1953 by Gale and Stewart.

Note : The original version in french can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/aparesy/TipeGaleStewart/blob/main/Tipe_2.pdf). I actually didn't translate everything by hand (ChatGPT helped me), so there might be some typos in the file below.
