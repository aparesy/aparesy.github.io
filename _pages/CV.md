Here's my resume : [View or download my resume (PDF)](/assets/ResumeAlexandreParesy.pdf)

(French version : [CV en français](/assets/ResumeFrancais.pdf))

Disclaimer regarding my current GPA (as of September 2025) : it is only calculated based on the classes I took from April 2025 to July 2025 (during the *Tronc Commun* period) as the first 6 months of the Ecole Polytechnique curriculum are dedicated to human formation and military training.

Nonetheless, it is official and I would be glad to send you a transcript if needed ; just shoot me an email !

I can also provide you with some of my grade transcripts from my preparatory class (*Louis-le-Grand*) or the competitive exams I took to get accepted into Polytechnique !
