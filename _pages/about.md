Hi there ! I'm Alexandre, a second year student at Ecole Polytechnique. I've always been a fan of problem-solving in various forms, for example by solving sudokus in the train to elementary school or by participating in many maths events and competitions in high school. Currently, I particularly enjoy computer science which takes up most of my courses as well as competitive programming : I'm currently trying to qualify for [ICPC SWERC](http://www.swerc.eu) ! 

I also really enjoy music as a violin player, badminton and playing video games. My aim with this website is to elaborate on these topics, and basically anything that interests me, as much as possible !

## On maths

One of the places where I've been to the most during high school is Bodo Lass' [discrete mathematics clubs](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~lass/club.html), in which I've been a member for 7 years. It's the biggest math club in France for young students who want to prepare competitions (for example the [Coupe Animaths](https://maths-olympiques.fr/?cat=16), France's olympiad math selection test) or just discover mathematics besides their regular school curriculum (and I just happened to live near it !). I used to particular enjoy combinatorics and number theory, which are both barely mentioned topics in high school. This also gave me confidence to enter some contests in high schools in which I performed unexpectedly well !

The club also made me discover the [mathraining](mathraining.be) website, which was originally targeted at belgian olympiad students, but became widespread over french-speaking students after some years. The site consists of a few topics which cover most of olympiad maths with complete courses and quizzes, as well as longer problems to which you can submit answers in LaTeX that will be corrected by (very patient) volunteers. It might seem very basic, but each problem gives you points and for a high schooler who just needed an excuse to skip more tedious tasks (such as studying for his next philosophy test) in order to spend his days solving math problems, it can quickly become very addictive ! However, at the end of high schools, I still didn't get as many points as some of my peers, so I was excited to do more maths in *prépa*.

## On music

I'm a violin player, so of course I have a soft spot for classical music. Besides having played in my high school orchestra, I'm also a member of the [Saclay plateau orchestra](orchestres-plateau-saclay.fr). Playing in an orchestra in front of a big audience is definitely a unique experience, and it's a lot more stressful than what it looks like from a spectator's point of view (or at least that's how I feel). Recently, one of my favorite pieces has been Bizet's Arlésienne :

## On computer science

As I explain [down below](#classe-préparatoire), the french education system makes you sacrifice 2 years of your life after leaving high school if you want to have a shot at the best scientific schools in the preparatory class limbo where you spend most of your time learning maths, physics and the dreaded chemistry. Thankfully, there are different tracks you can [choose between](https://www.onisep.fr/formation/apres-le-bac-les-etudes-superieures/les-principales-filieres-d-etudes-superieures/les-cpge-classes-preparatoires-aux-grandes-ecoles/les-prepas-scientifiques) and I managed to avoid chemistry by entering the MPI (Maths, Physics, Informatics) track, which just happened to be created 1 year prior ! Instead, the track applies a large focus on computer science and it was really enjoyable. We learn about pointers and memory allocation in C as well as functional programming in OCaml and a large part of the algorithms and theory you'd typically study in a BSc in CS. Unfortunately, there's no time for big projects but our second-year CS teacher still organized a competition in class to write the best AI for the [Oware game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware).

That very positive experience with CS I had in *prépa* drove me to choose this specialization at Polytechnique, though I technically still have the option to do pure maths since it's a very generalist school (some people have a complete change of heart and start doing social sciences after having passed their competitive exams in maths !). During my first year at Polytechnique (apart from the 6 months in the Navy !), I mostly 

## Ecole Polytechnique

Founded in 1794 by Napoleon, Ecole Polytechnique is France's most renowned engineering school and its entrance exam is particularly infamous. Having kept its military status, its students automatically enroll in the French military and carry out a 6-month long [military training and human formation period](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/program-details/year-1-of-the-ingenieur-polytechnicien-program). They also receive the mythical [Grand Uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Uniform_of_the_%C3%89cole_Polytechnique) and get to participate in the 14th of July military parade.

Nevertheless, Ecole Polytechnique particularly stands out for its scientific tradition, as it was home to many famous mathematicians and physicists, such as Mandelbrot, Carnot, Cauchy or Becquerel.

## Classe préparatoire

The french higher education system can be very confusing and the main reason for this is the *prépa* system, which is almost a Bachelor but also not at all a Bachelor. The main reason for choosing to do a *prépa* is that the best schools in France mainly accept students after they have cleared the entrance exams for their specific school which are so hard that students need to dedicate two years (or three if you repeat) after leaving high school to prepare for them.
