Hi there ! I'm Alexandre, a second year student at Ecole Polytechnique. I've always been a fan of problem-solving in various forms, for example by solving sudokus in the train to elementary school or by participating in many maths events and competitions in high school. Currently, I particularly enjoy computer science which takes up most of my courses as well as competitive programming : I'm currently trying to qualify for [ICPC SWERC](http://www.swerc.eu) ! 

I also really enjoy music as a violin player, badminton and playing video games. My aim with this website is to elaborate on these topics, and basically anything that interests me, as much as possible !

## On maths

One of the places where I've been to the most during high school is Bodo Lass' [discrete mathematics clubs](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~lass/club.html), in which I've been a member for 7 years. It's the biggest math club in France for young students who want to prepare competitions (for example the [Coupe Animaths](https://maths-olympiques.fr/?cat=16), France's olympiad math selection test) or just discover mathematics besides their regular school curriculum (and I just happened to live near it !). I used to particular enjoy combinatorics and number theory, which are both barely mentioned topics in high school. This also gave me confidence to enter some contests in high schools in which I performed unexpectedly well !

The club also made me discover the [mathraining](mathraining.be) website, which was originally targeted at belgian olympiad students, but became widespread over french-speaking students after some years. The site consists of a few topics which cover most of olympiad maths with complete courses and quizzes, as well as longer problems to which you can submit answers in LaTeX that will be corrected by (very patient) volunteers. It might seem very basic, but each problem gives you points and for a high schooler who just needed an excuse to skip more tedious tasks (such as studying for his next philosophy test) in order to spend his days solving math problems, it can quickly become very addictive ! However, at the end of high schools, I still didn't get as many points as some of my peers, so I was excited to do more maths in *prépa*.

## Ecole Polytechnique

Founded in 1794 by Napoleon, Ecole Polytechnique is France's most renowned engineering school and its entrance exam is particularly infamous. Having kept its military status, its students automatically enroll in the French military and carry out a 6-month long [military training and human formation period](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/program-details/year-1-of-the-ingenieur-polytechnicien-program). They also receive the mythical [Grand Uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Uniform_of_the_%C3%89cole_Polytechnique) and get to participate in the 14th of July military parade.

Nevertheless, Ecole Polytechnique particularly stands out for its scientific tradition, as it was home to many famous mathematicians and physicists, such as Mandelbrot, Carnot, Cauchy or Becquerel.

## Classe préparatoire

The french higher education system can be very confusing and the main reason for this is the *prépa* system, which is almost a Bachelor but also not at all a Bachelor. The main reason for choosing to do a *prépa* is that the best schools in France mainly accept students after they have cleared the entrance exams for their specific school which are so hard that students need to dedicate two years (or three if you repeat) after leaving high school to prepare for them.
