Hi there ! I'm Alexandre, a second year student at Ecole Polytechnique. I've always been a fan of problem-solving in various forms, for example by solving sudokus in the train to elementary school or by participating in many maths events and competitions in high school. Currently, I particularly enjoy computer science which takes up most of my courses as well as competitive programming : I'm currently trying to qualify for [ICPC SWERC](http://www.swerc.eu) ! 

I also really enjoy music as a violin player, badminton and playing video games. My aim with this website is to elaborate on these topics, and basically anything that interests me, as much as possible !






## Ecole Polytechnique

Founded in 1794 by Napoleon, Ecole Polytechnique is France's most renowned engineering school and its entrance exam is particularly infamous. Having kept its military status, its students automatically enroll in the French military and carry out a 6-month long [military training and human formation period](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/program-details/year-1-of-the-ingenieur-polytechnicien-program). They also receive the mythical [Grand Uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Uniform_of_the_%C3%89cole_Polytechnique) and get to participate in the 14th of July military parade.

Nevertheless, Ecole Polytechnique particularly stands out for its scientific tradition, as it was home to many famous mathematicians and physicists, such as Mandelbrot, Carnot, Cauchy or Becquerel.

## Classe préparatoire

The french higher education system can be very confusing and the main reason for this is the *prépa* system, which is almost a Bachelor but also not at all a Bachelor. The main reason for choosing to do a *prépa* is that the best schools in France mainly accept students after they have cleared the entrance exams for their specific school which are so hard that students need to dedicate two years (or three if you repeat) after leaving high school to prepare for them.
